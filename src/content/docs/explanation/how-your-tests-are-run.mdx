description: How Endform Runs Your Playwright Tests
---

Endform provides a distributed test runner optimized specifically for Playwright, designed to run your end-to-end tests faster and more efficiently.
Here's a breif explanation of how our test runner works.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Dependency Analysis

- When you start your tests using our CLI, Endform first analyzes your projectâ€™s `js`/`ts` test files.
- It calculates the exact JavaScript files required for each test to run.
- The CLI determines common dependencies across your entire test suite.
- The set of tests to run, and the dependencies required for each test, are then sent our test runner service.

### Step 2: Distributed Execution

- Endform starts a fully isolated machine for each test. Your tests run in dedicated Firecracker MicroVMs.
- Each machine receives only the specific test files and dependencies it requires.
- Each machine only ever runs one attempt of a test, the test runner can immidately schedule _more than one_ retry of a test when the first run fails.

### Step 3: Result Coordination

- Each test collects a playwright `blob-report` containing the result of the test.
- We always send your blob reports back to the cli. Once all your tests have finished, we run playwright's [`merge-reports` command](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding#merge-reports-cli)
  for you. This means that all of your existing playwright reporters will work as expected.
- We also collect the results of your tests and the traces they produce for you to view in the dashboard.

## Benefits

- Fast and Scalable: Run hundreds of tests in parallel without being limited by browser or network bottlenecks.
- Efficient: Minimized resource usage by isolating each test and its dependencies.
- Local Convenience: Execute large test suites effortlessly from your local machine.
