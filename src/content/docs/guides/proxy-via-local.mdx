description: How to proxy traffic from your remote runners to your local network. This helps to run tests against local servers

Servers that you want to test against that are either running locally or within a private network are not automatically exposed to the internet.
These servers are not reachable by default from the remotely running Playwright instances.
Trying to reach them without this extra setup, would likely result in connection errors in your tests.


When this happens, we need a method of shuttling traffic between the remote runners and the servers running on your local network.

Endform has the ability to connect the remote Playwright runners to the servers on your local network via direct, hole-punched, encrypted, peer-to-peer connections.
We can do this by utilizing the [iroh network](https://www.iroh.computer/docs/overview).

## Setting up endform to proxy traffic

<Aside>
Proxying traffic via your local network is currently in alpha, we would be grateful for any feedback you have on this feature.

<Steps>

1. ### Configure which traffic to proxy.
   
   #### As a playwright `webServer`
   If you want to run your local server as a [playwright `webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-web-server)
   then you're done! Leave your web server configuration as is, and we will automatically proxy the traffic to your local server.

   #### With your own custom server
   If you're running a server outside of playwright - that's fine. You can tell endform which traffic to proxy by using a `endform.jsonc` file.

   <Code language="json" title="endform.jsonc" code={`
   {
      "proxyNetworkHosts": [
        "<loopback>",
        "*.my-special-domain.com"
      ]
   }
   `} />

   You can read more about the `proxyNetworkHosts` configuration in the [endform config reference](/docs/reference/endform-config#proxy-network-hosts).

2. ### Run your tests!

   That's it! You can now run your tests as normal, and the traffic will be proxied via the cli to your target server.
