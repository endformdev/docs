Make sure to check out the [requirements](/docs/reference/requirements) before you start.

<Selector

<LocalCliContent suite="existing" target="local" />

<Aside>
Since endform is currently in beta, we recommend a very high update cadence of the CLI. Please try to keep within the _last 2 weeks_ of releases.
