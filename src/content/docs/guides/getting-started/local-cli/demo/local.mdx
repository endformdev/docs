Make sure to check out the [requirements](/docs/reference/requirements) before you start.

<Selector
  currentSuite="demo"
  currentTarget="local"
  currentRunner="local-cli"
/>

<LocalCliContent suite="demo" target="local" />

<Aside>
Since endform is currently in beta, we recommend a very high update cadence of the CLI. Please try to keep within the _last 2 weeks_ of releases.
