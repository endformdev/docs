import Selector from '../../../../../../components/getting-started/Selector.astro';
import OtherCiContent from '../../../../../../components/getting-started/content/OtherCiContent.astro';
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Make sure to check out the [requirements](/docs/reference/requirements) before you start.

<Selector
  currentSuite="existing"
  currentTarget="remote"
  currentRunner="other-ci"
/>

<OtherCiContent suite="existing" target="remote" />

<Aside>
Since endform is currently in beta, we recommend a very high update cadence of the CLI. Please try to keep within the _last 2 weeks_ of releases.
