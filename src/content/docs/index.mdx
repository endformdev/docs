Hi there! Thank you for taking an interest in Endform.

Endform is:

- A very fast _remote_ test runner for your playwright end-to-end tests.
- (Soon) A dashboard for viewing and analyzing your test results.

Endform is currently in early beta. If you're here, it's probably because we've given you early access,
and we appreciate you taking the time to try it out.
